Sentimental Analysis On Roman Urdu

This was my NLP Course Assignment. Using the dataset, which I got from hugging face, I made a sentimental analysis reviewer using Roman Urdu, which detects whether a sentence is negative, positive or neutral.

The model doesn't only assign a sentiment to a label but also gets the context thus also having a way to be sure that whether a sentence may be confusing or very simple.
